You are given a 2D array of single-digit numbers from 1 to 9.

You can form a 4 digit number, by choosing any one element from the 2D array, then selecting one adjacent to it (up, down, left or right) and so on, 4 times, without using the same element again.

What is the highest number you can get this way?

Performance matters.



Example:

For the followeing 2D array

```
13246
29513
81782
```

The answer is 9578
